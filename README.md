# 💻 Introduction to Computer Science – Task Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to over 100 algorithmic and programming exercises from the **"Introduction to Computer Science"** course (Wstęp do Informatyki) at **AGH University of Krakow**. The tasks cover a wide range of topics in procedural programming, algorithms, recursion, data structures, mathematical logic, and array processing.

🧠 The course emphasizes:
- Algorithmic thinking
- Writing and debugging Python programs
- Exploring classic computational problems
- Efficient use of arrays, loops, recursion, and memory

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each task is stored in its own folder, containing:
- 📄 `description.png` – screenshot of the original problem statement (in Polish)
- 🧠 `solution.py` – my implementation in C
- 📃 `README.md` (optional) – brief explanation and commentary on the solution

```


## 🧩 Sample Tasks

Here are just a few highlights of what you’ll find in this repo:
